                Water crises in Pakistan have been a persistent and severe issue, particularly in regions such as Mithi, where scarcity of clean water has significantly impacted the lives of the local population. Mithi, located in the Tharparkar district of Sindh province, has been grappling with water shortages, leading to dire consequences for the residents.

                Amidst this challenging situation, Al-Wahab Foundation stepped forward to assist the affected communities. One such beneficiary who received our assistance is Muhammad Ibrahim, a resident of Mithi.

              Muhammad Ibrahim, like many others in his community, faced the daily struggle of accessing safe and sufficient water for drinking, cooking, and other essential needs. The lack of proper water infrastructure left the residents vulnerable to waterborne diseases and forced them to travel long distances to fetch water from distant sources.

        “My name is Muhammad Ibrahim and I live here in Mithi. We are 14 family members and three of us are earning to meet our daily needs. Though survival is difficult with limited wages and rising inflation, even then we are struggling hard to make ends meet. The biggest problem we have been facing is of lacking access to clean drinking water. We have to go to far-off areas to fetch water and that water is also not clean and safe to drink.”

      Recognizing the urgency of the situation, Al-Wahab Foundation installed a hand pump in Muhammad Ibrahim’s locality. This hand pump serves as a reliable and accessible source of clean water for his family and the community around him.

      <p
      class="mt-2 text-grey text-base md:text-lg font-medium text-justify px-4 md:px-24"

    “We are greatly thankful to Al-Wahab Foundation and Mufti Abdul Wahab for understanding our problem and installing this water hand pump that will serve us a good purpose in the provision of safe and clean drinking water.”
    </p>
    <p
    class="mt-2 text-grey text-base md:text-lg font-medium text-justify px-4 md:px-24"

  The installation of the hand pump by Al-Wahab Foundation has brought about a transformative change in the lives of the local residents. Now, instead of spending hours traveling to distant areas in search of water, they have a convenient water source within their vicinity. This has not only saved time and physical effort but also improved their overall health and well-being.

“May Allah bless Mufti Abdul Wahab and the dedicated team of Al-Wahab Foundation for this kindness. Your help has provided us great relief for the lifetime.”

Donating water in Muharram holds special significance as it symbolizes compassion and empathy towards the sufferings endured during the tragic events of Karbala. Just as the noble Imam Hussain (A.S) and his companions faced the harsh desert without access to water, donating water during this month serves as a way to alleviate the thirst of those in need. It is a reminder of the selflessness and sacrifice demonstrated by Imam Hussain (A.S) and his followers, inspiring us to show kindness and support to those facing water crises and other hardships in our communities.

Muhammad Ibrahim and his community are immensely grateful for the support they have received from Al-Wahab Foundation with the support of respectable donors. The provision of a hand pump has significantly alleviated their water-related hardships and has given them hope for a better future.
