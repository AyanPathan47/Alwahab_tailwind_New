                Meet Akbar – a resident of Mithi, a village in Sindh, Pakistan. Like many others in his community, Akbar faced numerous hardships in accessing clean drinking water. The village lacked proper water infrastructure, forcing its inhabitants to travel long distances to collect water from open and often contaminated sources. This strenuous task fell mostly on the shoulders of the children, who had to endure long walks, risking exposure to various elements and health challenges.

                The village’s primary water source was a stagnant pond shared by animals for drinking and people for bathing and washing clothes. Consequently, the water was heavily polluted, making the villagers vulnerable to waterborne diseases, resulting in frequent gastrointestinal issues like diarrhoea and dehydration.

              Akbar, a father of three, recounted the challenges they endured daily:

            <p class="mt-2 text-grey text-base md:text-lg font-medium text-justify">“My name is Akbar, and I reside in Mithi with my family. Our village has been facing numerous issues, but the most persistent one was the lack of access to clean drinking water. We used to walk long distances to fetch water from a dirty pond, which took up a significant portion of our time and energy. Moreover, the water we collected wasn’t safe for consumption, and we often fell sick. This situation made it even more challenging for us to make ends meet, and the health of our family members was always at risk.”</p>
      
          
            <p class="mt-2 text-grey text-base md:text-lg font-medium text-justify ">Fortunately, Al-Wahab Foundation stepped forward and installed a water hand pump, one of the many water solutions they provide in various communities across Pakistan. The hand pump ensured access to a safer underground water source, transforming the lives of the local residents almost overnight. With this convenient water source right in their village, they no longer had to embark on long journeys to collect water. The hand pump not only saved them time and physical effort but also significantly improved their overall health and well-being.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-grey text-base md:text-lg font-medium text-justify ">Akbar expressed his gratitude towards the Al-Wahab Foundation:</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-grey text-base md:text-lg font-medium text-justify ">“We are immensely grateful to Al-Wahab Foundation and Mufti Abdul Wahab for understanding our struggles and installing this water hand pump. It has been a tremendous help, providing us with safe and clean drinking water right at our doorstep. May Allah reward them for this generosity.”</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-grey text-base md:text-lg font-medium text-justify ">Join hands with Al-Wahab Foundation and extend support to our brothers and sisters who are suffering without this essential resource that we often take for granted.
