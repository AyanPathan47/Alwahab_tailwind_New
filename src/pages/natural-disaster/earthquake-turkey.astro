We lost our home, our belongings, and our means of income. Providing for my children became an overwhelming challenge, as we struggled to find food, clean water, and other necessities.It was a time of immense uncertainty and fear for our future. We are deeply grateful to the Al-Wahab Foundation and Mufti Abdul Wahab for their understanding and support during this difficult time. The Emergency Relief Package they provided has been a true blessing for my family. I am thankful to Almighty Allah that we still have got kind people like Mufti Abdul Wahab and the dedicated team of Al-Wahab Foundation to help suffering families in bringing ease to them.",
