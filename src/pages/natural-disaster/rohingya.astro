      Bring Hope to Rohingya Refugees
    </p>
    <p class="text-grey text-sm md:text-lg text-center mt-5 px-2  md:px-60">
      In August 2017, the people of Rohingya confronted brutal genocide in
      Myanmar, leaving them displaced and devastated. Hundreds and thousands
      were reported dead while many began to flee to Bangladesh in a traumatic
      state.
    </p>
    <p class="text-grey text-sm md:text-lg text-center mt-5 px-2 md:px-60">
      As of now, after the <strong>Rohingya crisis</strong>, there are approximately over 1
      million refugees who are managing their survival in the highly populated
      Coxâ€™s Bazar, recorded as the largest refugee camp in the world. To
      alleviate their suffering, Al-Wahab Foundation is on the ground to provide
      sustenance for better survival through the <strong>Rohingya Emergency Appeal.</strong>
