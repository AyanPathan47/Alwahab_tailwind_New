We used to walk long distances to fetch water from a dirty pond, which took up a significant portion of our time and energy. Moreover, the water we collected wasn't safe for consumption, and we often fell sick. This situation made it even more challenging for us to make ends meet, and the health of our family members was always at risk. We are immensely grateful to Al-Wahab Foundation and Mufti Abdul Wahab for understanding our struggles and installing this water hand pump. It has been a tremendous help, providing us with safe and clean drinking water right at our doorstep. May Allah reward them for this generosity.",

                    Africa faces a severe water crisis, with a significant
                    portion of its population lacking access to clean and safe
                    water sources. The scarcity of clean water poses a
                    significant threat to public health and exacerbates the
                    vulnerability of communities, particularly women and
                    children, to waterborne diseases. In response to this
                    situation specifically <a
