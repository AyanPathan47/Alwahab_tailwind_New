The scarcity of food is a persistent issue, and providing nourishment for my children is a daily challenge. We depend on occasional work opportunities, but they are not enough to ensure a stable supply of food. We often go to bed hungry, and my heart aches to see my children suffer. I am greatly thankful to Al-Wahab Foundation and Mufti Abdul Wahab for their understanding and compassion towards our difficulty. The food packs they provided have been a lifeline for my family. We now have enough to eat for the entire month as it includes every food staple ensuring nourishing meals for my family, and my children no longer go to bed hungry. I am truly humbled by this kindness from Al-Wahab Foundation and Mufti Abdul Wahab. We will pray for them every day.",

        Your donation towards our <a class="text-maroon font-bold hover:text-customBeige duration-300" href="">food packs donation</a> can save impoverished families from continuing hunger.
        Without food supply or reliable income, many people are forced to beg, suffering humiliation and
        exploitation. Parents often go without food, giving the little they have to their children to try and combat 
        the devasting effects of malnutrition on growing bodies. <br />
        <br />
        Your <a class="text-maroon hover:text-customBeige duration-300 font-bold" href="">Zakat</a> or <a class="text-maroon hover:text-customBeige hover:duration-300 font-bold" href="">Sadaqah donation</a>
        can pay for a one month’s supply of food staples for a family in need.
        Our packs include flour, rice, sugar, lentils, powdered milk plus other essential food items to enable families to 
        have nutritious and fulfilling meals. With your generosity we can ensure people who have lost everything 
        due to natural disaster, flooding and long-term poverty are sustained and energised without the worry of 
        how to find their next meal from our food packs donation project.

        Since 2014, we provided food packs to 143,980 people in desperate need
        of help. We are committed to easing the suffering of people across Pakistan where food poverty remains
        an alarming problem. Over 40% of the population do not have enough food each day and more than 20% suffer
        malnutrition. Donate Al- Wahab Foundation’s food packs donation project today to help the needy. <br/>
        <br />

        Our established network is growing and with your continued support we
        can reach more people in need. Recent flooding in the region has destroyed crops and livestock disrupting
        agriculture and food supply, leaving even more people starving and at risk. Our local knowledge means
        we are on the ground, reaching people and bringing hope. <br /><br />
        Donate today and your support of Sadaqah or Zakat will help to feed hungry
