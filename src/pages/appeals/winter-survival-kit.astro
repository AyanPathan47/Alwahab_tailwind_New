                    Afghanistan has been struggling for a long time under dire situations due to 
                    various circumstances, making it difficult for them to survive. There are many 
                    who are compelled to live life of homelessness while others struggle to meet 
                    their everyday needs. Last year, Afghanistan faced the aftermath of earthquake
                    that exacerbated their struggles. As winter approaches, your winter donation for 
                    Afghanistan can provide essential winter survival kits, offering relief to those 
                    grappling with numerous challenges.
