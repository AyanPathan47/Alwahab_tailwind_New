                Thanks to you and thousands like you, we have been able to rebuild more than 50 mosques across Pakistan so far, benefitting more than 14,000 people who have lost access to a suitable place for prayer.<br />
                <br />

                These masjids provide not just a beautiful place for worship; they also bring people together in the toughest of times, providing a safe haven and uplifting the spirits of those who are struggling. By working in some of the more impoverished areas, your support in repairing local masjids can bring hope and community strength. From daily congregational prayers to educational activities, essential service, support and advice, the mosques you help rebuild are a beacon of a brighter future.
