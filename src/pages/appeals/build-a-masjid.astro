However, Al-Wahab Foundation built this beautiful and spacious mosque in our village.

                A mosque is the heart of the community, a place full of peace
                that brings the community together. In rural areas, where mosques are damaged and
                unsafe due to floods, storm or earthquake, having a suitable place to pray again
                can feel out of reach. Finding the funds or resources to rebuild a masjid is impossible
                in the daily battle for survival. You can help. Give them a place to worship once
                again.

                Thanks to you and thousands like you, we have been able to rebuild more than 50 mosques across Pakistan so far, benefitting more than 14,000 people who have lost access to a suitable place for prayer.
                
            <p class="md:px-16 text-base font-medium text-grey md:text-lg">
                These masjids provide not just a beautiful place for worship; they also bring people together in the toughest of times, providing a safe haven and uplifting the spirits of those who are struggling. By working in some of the more impoverished areas, your support in repairing local masjids can bring hope and community strength. From daily congregational prayers to educational activities, essential service, support and advice, the mosques you help rebuild are a beacon of a brighter future.
