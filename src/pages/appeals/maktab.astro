It feels like I am left behind, and it's disheartening to see my dreams being shattered. I am incredibly thankful to the Al-Wahab Foundation and Mufti Abdul Wahab for giving me this opportunity to study through Maktab initiative. Now, I can pursue my dreams and learn like other children. I am eager to learn and grow, and I promise to work hard to make my family proud. I thank to Mufti Abdul Wahab and Al-Wahab Foundation for supporting me so that I can have a brighter future.",

We strongly believe that the best form of education is that which balances worldly matters with religious and spiritual growth, which is why we designed our <span class="text-grey font-bold">Maktab project</span> to focus on both aspects of education. <br><br>Our school curriculum includes secular and Islamic subjects such as English, Maths, Urdu, Tajweed, Fiqh, Hadith, reading, and writing taught under the supervision of qualified Qaris. The purpose of our Maktabs is to support deprived students who cannot afford to study due to financial constraints. Your support ensures we can provide consistent, quality education, sharing the Qur’an, raising literacy rates, attainment and keeping children safe from exploitation.
