                Determining your Zakat seems to be a difficult task. However, it isn’t as challenging <br>
                as you might think of it. All you need to do is categorise your assets and liabilities in a <br>
                way that makes it convenient for you to <span class="font-bold">calculate Zakat</span>. To make it even more <br>
                convenient and quick, use our Zakat Calculator to find out how much you need <br>
                to pay.

            <p class="py-3 text-center text-grey text-base md:text-xl font-medium">
                AWF Zakat Calculator has simplified the calculation by dividing assets into items to <br>
                be considered to pay Zakat for (such as gold, silver, cash, savings, and business <br>
                assets) and deductible liabilities (including debts and other outgoing payments). <br>
                Using this breakdown, you can easily calculate Zakat. 
            </p>
            <p class="py-3 text-center text-grey text-base md:text-xl font-medium">
                Once you assess the value of your net assets, you can determine the amount of Zakat <br>
                 owed. It’s crucial to compare your net assets to the nisab threshold to find out <br>
                  whether Zakat is obligatory.
