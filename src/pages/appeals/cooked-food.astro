It may seem like a small thing to some people, but for families like mine, this help means that someone cares and that we’re not forgotten by society.

            Food insecurity in Pakistan is continuing to rise due to severe

            You can change this by donating today and <br />providing cooked
            food to those who are struggling by providing <br />nourishment and
            relieving hunger.
