In such difficult times, when Al-Wahab Foundation provided free meals to me and my family, I just felt overwhelmed with gratitude.  It may seem like a small thing to some people, but for families like mine, this help means that someone cares and that we’re not forgotten by society. I just want to thank everyone who contributed to this project. The way Mufti Abdul Wahab is helping deprived people around is really commendable.

            Food insecurity in Pakistan is continuing to rise due to severe
            weather and <br />flooding destroying food supply chains. More than
            3 million children now <br />face chronic hunger. For thousands of
            families suffering malnourishment,<br /> a hot meal is out of reach.
            You can change this by donating today and <br />providing cooked
            food to those who are struggling by providing <br />nourishment and
            relieving hunger.
